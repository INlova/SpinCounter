      All files are analyzed in browser so the application can perform well even without internet connection.
      The app doesn't send your information to any web servers. This approach ensures sufficient privacy of your personal data.<br>
      Previous version of the application (as a desktop app) has recieved a lot of positive
      feedback and taken place as a software tool among many players.
    +e('h2').header How To Use
    +e('p').text-block.
      First of all, you should click on the upload icon on the home page and choose the folder
      which stores your Tournament Summary files (<a class="help-content__dwnload-link" href="data/test.rar">you can download test files here</a>). If there aren't any valid files,
      an error message will appear.
    +e('img').img(src='img/upload-error.jpg' width='426' height='47' alt='Upload error')
    +e('p').text-block.
      After you chose the folder, files would be uploaded and proceeding will start. 
      The result table will appear after all the files will have been analyzed. To download other tournaments, you should go
      to the main page of the application, click again on the download icon and select another folder - new 
      results will be calculated (previous results will be lost).

    +e('p').text-block.
      To view the results for the buy-in you need or for the total information - click 
      on the appropriate button.
    +e('img').img(src='img/limits.jpg' width='912' height='45' alt='Buy-ins')
    +e('p').text-block.
      By using date filters at the top of the page, you can get results for the defined period of time.
    +e('img').img(src='img/dates.jpg' width='912' height='40' alt='Date filter')
    +e('p').text-block.
      This filter allows you to choose preset date ranges (in that case filtration will proceed automatically) or manually set the 
      required period of time with calendars (in that case you should click 'Apply Filter' button). If there aren't played tournaments 
      in chosen date range, an error message will appear.

    +e('p').text-block.
      The summary results for 'Expected' and 'Difference' of specific buy-ins are divided into two values: the first one includes 
      the possibility of getting top3 multipliers and the second one doesn't.<br>
      Summary results for 'Expected' are viewed as a sum of all tournaments prize pool expressed as buy-ins, while values for 
      multipliers are expressed as a quantity of tournaments.<br>
      Summary results for 'Difference' are shown as a percentage deviation of actual prize pool sum from expected (positive value - actual sum 
      is bigger than expected; negative value - lower than expected).
